# Ruby Number Guessing Game
This is another game I wrote at Rails Girls Wellington. This game has the computer generate a random number between 1 and 10 and then allows the user to guess what the number is.

###Features of Interest
I added some fun extras to the basic game that I wanted to share with anyone else who's learning Ruby fundamentals like me.
- The machine detects whether your guess was too high or too low and gives you an appropriate hint
- If you guess the correct number on your first try, you get a special message that recognises your achievement
- If it takes you more that 3 tries to guess the number, you lose and the correct number is revealed to you along with a message

I hope you find this project useful for learning about loops and breaks in Ruby, or at the very least a good bit of fun to fill in an afternoon!
Thanks for looking!
